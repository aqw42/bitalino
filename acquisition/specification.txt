Software Specification for BITalino Acquisition System
=====================================================

1. Sensor List and Association
-----------------------------
- The system supports multiple sensors connected to a BITalino device.
- Each sensor is associated with a unique analog input port.
- Each sensor has a type: EMG, EEG, or ECG.
- The sensor type determines the transfer function used for signal processing.

2. Graphs per Sensor
--------------------
For each sensor, the following graphs are generated:
  a. Raw Voltage Data (time domain)
  b. Raw FFT (frequency domain)
  c. Filtered FFT (frequency domain)
     - Filtering: Low-pass filter at 5 Hz and a narrow notch filter at 50 Hz

3. OpenSoundControlEndpoints
---------------------------
- Each sensor has a distinct set of OpenSoundControl (OSC) endpoints.
- Endpoints are prefixed with "/<type><index>/" (e.g., /EMG1/, /EEG2/).

4. Configuration File (config.txt)
----------------------------------
A separate configuration file will specify:
  - BITalino MAC address
  - Data buffer size
  - Sampling rate
  - OSC refresh rate
  - OSC IP address
  - OSC port
  - List of sensor ports and their types (e.g., A1: EMG, A2: EEG)

5. Notes
--------
- The configuration file must be updated by the user to match their hardware setup.
- The software will use the configuration to initialize acquisition, processing, and OSC endpoint setup.
